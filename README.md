# real_estate_sales_data_scrapping

This script enable the user to scrap sales history data from govmap site.

This site has acces to history data of sales from the Ministry of Justice database. 

The site is a GIS system of Israel and in this script we will take advantage
of the map display to focus on a specific area of interest from the map.

An end user can do the same in the govmap website but what distinguish this script is that we will get all the data in an easy digest excel spreadsheet.
